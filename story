** story**
The original film (Star Wars), 
retroactively subtitled Episode IV: 
A New Hope (1977), was followed by the 
sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
 (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), 
 forming the original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later 
 returned to filmmaking to direct a prequel trilogy,
  consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999),
  e II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III
  evenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his
   production company to Disney, relinquishing his
    ownership of the franchise. The subsequently
     produced sequel trilogy consists of Episod
      VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII:
       The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: 
The Rise of Skywalker (2019).

All nine films of the 'Skywalker saga' were
 nominated for Academy Awards with wins going 
 to the first two releases. Together with the
  theatrical live action spin-off films Rogue
  One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box 
  office revenue of the films equated to over
  US$10 billion, which makes it the second-highest
  -grossing film franchise of all time,[3][4] and
   fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all 
   time.
